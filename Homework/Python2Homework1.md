# Python-II Homework-1

* Write Math1.py include the following function definitions
```py
def add(x,y):
    pass

def sub(x,y):
    pass

def mul(x,y):
    pass

def div(x,y):
    pass
```

Check the type of arguments x and y, if the type is not int or float, raise error. Should write code to use those function as well.

* Define a function use try-except bolck to avoid execution interruption.
